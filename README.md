This project utilizes OpenCV and YOLOv8 to read individual handwritten numerical and alphabetical characters through a webcam. It provides a real-time solution for character recognition, enabling the extraction and identification of characters from live video feed.
Handwritten Character Recognition using OpenCV and YOLOv8
This project utilizes OpenCV and YOLOv8 to read individual handwritten numerical and alphabetical characters through a webcam. It provides a real-time solution for character recognition, enabling the extraction and identification of characters from live video feed.

# Features
->Real-time character recognition using a webcam feed
->Detection and localization of handwritten characters using YOLOv8
->Preprocessing techniques for enhancing character recognition accuracy
->Integration with OpenCV for webcam access and video processing
->Display of recognized characters on-screen or storage for further analysis
# Installation
->Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-character-recognition.git
->Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
->Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 model best.pt
->Run the application: python detection.py
# Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
Run the application using the installation steps mentioned above.
The webcam feed will open, and the application will start detecting and recognizing handwritten characters in real-time.
The recognized characters will be displayed on the screen or stored for further analysis, as per the project configuration.
